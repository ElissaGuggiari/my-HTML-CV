    <h1>Elissa Guggiari
        Graphic Designer</h1>
        <p>Passionate about typography and the communicative potential of individual graphic characters.
            My Bachelor thesis focused on the synaesthetic analysis of the letters of the alphabet,
            to create a personal representation in illustrations and animations.
            Able to work closely with others in a team environment as well as individually,
            I am punctual and flexible in my approach to work.</p>
